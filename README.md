# tasks-mcp

A personal kanban board as a local MCP server, backed by SQLite. Four columns — `backlog → in_progress → testing → done` — driven entirely through typed MCP tools: Claude pulls your tasks, adds new ones, edits them, and moves them across the board.

Tasks are never hard-deleted: archiving hides a task from listings but keeps it in the database.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended, not required — see the venv option below)

## Install & run

### Option A: uv (recommended)

From this directory:

```bash
uv run tasks-mcp
```

That resolves the environment, installs the single runtime dependency (`fastmcp`), and serves over stdio — uv even downloads a suitable Python if the machine has none. It is also exactly what an MCP host runs for you (see below).

The `tasks-mcp` / `tasks-mcp-web` console scripts exist too, but prefer the `python -m tasks_mcp` / `python -m tasks_mcp.web` module form for anything long-running: Windows locks a running `.exe`, which blocks `uv run` from refreshing the environment while a server is up.

To install uv itself, see the [official installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Option B: plain venv (no uv)

```powershell
# Windows
py -3.13 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\pip install -e .
```

```bash
# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e .
```

The server is then the `tasks-mcp` entry point inside the venv (`.venv\Scripts\tasks-mcp.exe` on Windows, `.venv/bin/tasks-mcp` elsewhere). Re-run the `pip install` step after pulling dependency changes.

## Registering with Claude Desktop / Cowork

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows: `%AppData%\Claude\`, macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tasks": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["--directory", "C:\\dev\\mcp-kanban", "run", "python", "-m", "tasks_mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

On macOS/Linux use the absolute path to this folder in `--directory`. If `uv` is not on the host's PATH, use the full path to the executable (`where uv` / `which uv`). Restart the Claude app fully after saving.

If you went with the venv install (Option B), point the config straight at the entry point instead — no `args` needed:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tasks": {
      "command": "C:\\dev\\mcp-kanban\\.venv\\Scripts\\tasks-mcp.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

(macOS/Linux: `"command": "/path/to/mcp-kanban/.venv/bin/tasks-mcp"`.)

Then try: *"add a task to buy milk"*, *"show my board"*, *"move it to testing"*.

## Configuration

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `TASKS_MCP_DB` | `~/.local/share/tasks-mcp/tasks.db` | SQLite database path (parent dir is created) |
| `TASKS_MCP_TRANSITIONS` | `free` | Transition policy. `free` = any column to any column. Hook for a future `linear` policy. |
| `TASKS_MCP_WEB_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address for the web view. |
| `TASKS_MCP_WEB_PORT` | `8765` | Port for the web view. |
| `TASKS_MCP_WEB_AUTOSTART` | `0` | Opt-in: `1` makes MCP sessions spawn the web view if it isn't running. |

Set them via the `env` key of the MCP config entry if you want a non-default location.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `add_task` | Create a task (lands in `backlog`). Title required; optional description, priority (`low`/`normal`/`high`), tags, link. |
| `list_tasks` | List tasks with optional AND-combined filters: status, tag, priority, `include_archived`. |
| `get_task` | Full detail of one task by id (works for archived tasks). |
| `edit_task` | Update title/description/priority/tags/link. Omitted fields keep their value; empty-string description or link clears it. |
| `move_task` | Move a task to another column — the kanban action. |
| `archive_task` | Soft delete. No hard delete exists. |
| `get_board` | The whole board grouped by column; always all four columns, in order. |
| `resume_task` | Open a new terminal resuming a task's linked Claude Code chat. Without a task id it shows an interactive picker (MCP elicitation, rendered by the client). |
| `browse_board` | Interactive board browsing in one tool call: chained client-rendered pickers navigate columns and tasks and can move/archive/resume — no model round-trips between steps, so every hop is instant. |
| `open_board` | Start the local web server if needed and open the drag-and-drop board in the default browser. |

## Web view (drag & drop board)

A browser UI over the same database, runnable alongside the MCP server (WAL mode makes concurrent access safe). Start it when you want the visual board:

```bash
uv run python -m tasks_mcp.web        # or .venv\Scripts\python -m tasks_mcp.web with the venv install
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8765>. Every MCP session (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, ...) is its own process, but they all share the database with this one web view, so it reflects everything live.

To have it always available, run it at login — e.g. a shortcut in `shell:startup` pointing at `.venv\Scripts\pythonw.exe -m tasks_mcp.web` (`pythonw` runs without a console window). There is also an opt-in convenience: set `TASKS_MCP_WEB_AUTOSTART=1` in the MCP server's environment and whichever session starts first spawns the board in the background if it isn't running. Drag cards between columns to move them, click a card to edit or archive it, add tasks from the header. The page polls every few seconds, so changes Claude makes through MCP appear on their own.

It exposes the same seven operations as JSON endpoints (`/api/board`, `/api/tasks`, `/api/tasks/{id}`, `/api/tasks/{id}/move`, `/api/tasks/{id}/archive`) and is built on the stdlib HTTP server — no new dependencies, no build step. Binds to localhost only by default (`TASKS_MCP_WEB_HOST` / `TASKS_MCP_WEB_PORT` to change).

## Parking a Claude Code chat as a task

Tasks have an optional `link` field: a URL or command that reopens the task's context. The built-in use case is parking a Claude Code session — "make a task so I can pick this up tomorrow" — and resuming it later with one paste.

**One-time setup.** Claude Code doesn't expose the session id to the agent directly, but hooks receive it. *If you installed the plugin (see below), skip this — it ships this hook.* Otherwise, add a `SessionStart` hook to `~/.claude/settings.json` that writes it where the agent can read it:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "powershell -NoProfile -Command \"$i=[Console]::In.ReadToEnd()|ConvertFrom-Json; New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path (Join-Path $i.cwd '.claude') | Out-Null; Set-Content -Path (Join-Path $i.cwd '.claude\\last-session-id') -Value $i.session_id\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Then teach the agent the convention in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
When I ask you to "park this chat" (save work to continue later):
1. Read `.claude/last-session-id` in the project root — that is this session's id.
2. Call the tasks MCP `add_task` tool with:
   - title: what we're in the middle of
   - description: enough state and next steps to resume cold
   - tags: ["parked"]
   - link: "cd <absolute project dir>; claude -r <session-id>"
```

**Resuming.** Three ways, all opening a new terminal already running `claude -r <session-id>` in the right directory:

- `/resume-task` in Claude Code — with no arguments it shows an interactive picker of linked tasks (arrow keys, rendered by the CLI via MCP elicitation); with an id or title keyword it resumes directly.
- The web board — cards whose link matches the resume shape show a `▶ resume` button. (Other links show a `⧉ link` copy chip.)
- Manually — copy the link and paste it into a terminal.

Resume execution is deliberately narrow everywhere: nothing but the exact `cd <dir>; claude -r <session-id>` shape is ever launched, rebuilt from parsed parts, and the web endpoint additionally requires a custom header so no cross-origin webpage can trigger it against your localhost server.

## Installing as a Claude Code plugin (recommended)

This repo is itself a plugin (and its own marketplace): one install brings the MCP server, the three slash commands, and the session-parking hook together. In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add stikkeruip/mcp-kanban
/plugin install kanban@mcp-kanban
```

(The plugin is named `kanban`, not `tasks` — `/tasks` is a built-in Claude Code command and plugin names should not shadow built-ins.)

(For local testing before pushing: `/plugin marketplace add C:\dev\mcp-kanban` then install the same way. `claude plugin validate .` checks the manifest.)

If you previously registered the server manually, remove it to avoid a duplicate: `claude mcp remove tasks`. The plugin's hook replaces the manual `SessionStart` hook from the parking section, and the plugin's server launches via `uv --directory ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, so it needs no per-machine paths.

Plugin commands are namespaced:

| Command | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `/kanban:ui` | Open the drag-and-drop board in the browser (starts the web server if needed). The board and the chat share one database, so each always sees the other's changes. |
| `/kanban:board` | Interactive board in the terminal: arrow-key pickers for columns and tasks, with move/archive/resume actions. One model turn to start, then every step is instant (elicitation, no model in the loop). |
| `/kanban:fetch-tasks [filters]` | Deterministic filters: `backlog`/`in_progress`/`testing`/`done`, `tag:<x>`, `priority:<x>`, `archived`. No args → the whole board as a table. Slower than `/kanban:board` — the model formats the output. |
| `/kanban:add-task` | Hybrid: `"<title>" [--high\|--low] [--tag <t>]... [--desc "..."] [--link]` is applied literally (`--link` attaches this session's resume command); anything without flags is a sentence the agent turns into a task. |
| `/kanban:resume-task [id\|keyword]` | No args → interactive picker of linked tasks. Id or unique title keyword → resumes directly. |

Prefer un-namespaced `/fetch-tasks` etc.? Copy `commands/*.md` to `~/.claude/commands/` instead of installing the plugin — but then the server registration and hook are back to manual setup.

Caveats: `claude -r` only finds the session from the directory it was created in (that's why the `cd` is part of the stored command), and if two Claude Code sessions run in the same project simultaneously, the last one to start owns `last-session-id` — in that case ask the agent to double-check against the newest transcript in `~/.claude/projects/`.

## Architecture

Dependencies point inward: `mcp → services → storage(interface) + domain`.

```
src/tasks_mcp/
├── domain/       # pure data + rules, zero I/O (Task, Status, Priority, TransitionPolicy)
├── storage/      # TaskRepository interface, SQLite impl, versioned migration runner
├── services/     # TaskService — all business logic, typed exceptions
├── mcp/          # thin, disposable adapter: MCP tools
├── web/          # thin, disposable adapter: JSON API + drag-and-drop board UI
├── wiring.py     # shared composition: config → service object graph
└── config.py     # env resolution in one place
```

Design decisions worth knowing:

- **Storage is swappable.** The service layer codes against the abstract `TaskRepository`; the SQLite implementation (raw SQL, no ORM) is the only file that knows how a task is stored. WAL mode is on, so a future read-only consumer (e.g. an HTML board view) can read while the server writes.
- **Schema changes are migrations.** A versioned runner applies `NNN_*.sql` files in order, each in its own transaction, on every startup. Adding a field later = dropping a new `002_*.sql` file next to `001_initial.sql`. Never a manual `ALTER`.
- **Transitions are a policy object.** v1 ships `FreeTransitionPolicy`. A strict linear pipeline is a new class registered in `mcp/server.py` and selected via `TASKS_MCP_TRANSITIONS` — zero changes to existing code.
- **Adapters are disposable.** MCP tools and web endpoints alike parse input, call one service method, format output. The web view was added without touching a line beneath the adapter layer — the proof the seams work.

## Development

```bash
uv sync                # create venv with dev deps
uv run pytest          # domain, storage, services, MCP protocol, web API
```

The service tests run against an in-memory SQLite repository; the MCP tests exercise the wired server through an in-memory MCP client; the web tests hit a live threaded server over real HTTP.
